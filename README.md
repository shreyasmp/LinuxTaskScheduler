# LinuxTaskScheduler
Completely Fair Linux Scheduler using Red Black Trees

This was a Grad School Project that was executed in Fall 2013 with my fellow teammate Sushruth, who is no more

The goal of this project was to write a Linux Task Scheduler using Red Black Trees or popularly known as RB-Trees

A brief understanding on Red Black Trees and its self balancing nature on node addition/deletion can be read here:
